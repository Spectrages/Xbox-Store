# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

In this project, I implemented user interaction in an online store. At the moment, not all product pages are ready, but it will grow and expand.

The first gif shows the start page of the site

When you enter an email in the modal window, a message will be sent to that email.

At the moment, only the button of the "Controllers" block works.
Pagination and product filter work.

The interaction of the user with the goods works, the choice of goods, colors, the correct calculation of the price. The repository is made with the Redux Toolkit.

The development of the project is ongoing, stay tuned.
